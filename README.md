# numberplate-identifer

**About:**
During road trips in germany,i always like to play games to identify the orign of the vehicles in front of me. German numberplates usually have certain identifiers such as the initials, which give me a good chance at guessing where the vehicle is from, i.e B is Berlin, HH is Hamburg(Hansastadt Hamburg), vica versa. This gave me the idea to create a site which lets users input the initials of a car and provides the correct city that it is associated with.
